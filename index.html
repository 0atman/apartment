    <h1>Tufte CSS</h1>
    <subtitle>Dave Liepmann</subtitle>
    <section>
      <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>

      <p>The project lives at GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. The idea is essentially cribbed wholesale from Tufte-<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown's Tufte Handout format</a><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup> See <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/" class="url">https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/</a></span>. This page is an adaptation of the <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/examples/tufte-handout.pdf">Tufte Handout PDF</a>. I give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <span class="code">tufte.css</span> and <span class="code">ETBembo-RomanLF.ttf</span> to your project directory and add the following to your HTML document's <span class="code">head</span> block:</p>

      <pre class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
      href="tufte.css"/&gt;</pre>

      <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
      <h3>Sections</h3>
      <p>Organize your document with an <span class="code">article</span> element inside your <span class="code">body</span> tag. Inside that, use <span class="code">section</span> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
      
      <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>Tufte CSS uses <span class="code">h1</span> for the document title, <span class="code">h2</span> for section headings, and <span class="code">h3</span> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
        <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
        <footer><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">Edward Tufte, forum post, 'Book design: advice and examples' thread</a></footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="newthought">In his later books</span><sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup> <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be" class="url">http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be</a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <span class="code">newthought</span>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. The vertical space is accomplished separately, through the <span class="code">&lt;section&gt;</span> class. I feel the vertical space is unnecessary when using this technique to replace <span class="code">h2</span> elements, as in this paragaph. Be consistent: though I do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <span class="code">newthought</span> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. I picked <span class="code">#fffff8</span> and <span class="code">#111111</span> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their 'pure' cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. </p>      
      <p>Other forms of text&mdash;for instance, links and code&mdash;are slightly lighter, and sidenote numbers are bright red to distinguish them from inline text.</p>
      
      <h3>Font</h3>
      <p>In print, Tufte uses the proprietary Monotype Bembo<sup class="sidenote-number">3</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">3</sup> <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt" class="url">http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt</a></span> font. In digital formats he uses ETBembo, which Tufte CSS includes using <span class="code">@font-face</span>. This means you'll have to make the .ttf file available to your readers. Note that <a href="https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css/commit/0a810a7d5f4707941c6f9fe99a53ec41f50a5c00">thanks to Linjie Ding</a>, italicized text uses the ETBembo Italic font instead of mechanically skewing the characters.</p>
      <p>Code snippets (using the <span class="code">code</span> class) ape GitHub's font selection and sans-serifs (with the <span class="sans">sans</span> class) follow Tufte's choice of Gill Sans.</p>

      <h2>Sidenotes</h2>
      <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of sidenotes. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
      <p>There is a wide margin to provide ample room for sidenotes and small figures. Spans with class <span class="code">sidenote</span> inserted directly into the middle of <span class="code">p</span> tags within each <span class="code">section</span> put the sidenote at the correct height. <sup class="sidenote-number">4</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">4</sup> This is a sidenote.</span></p>
        <p>Most sidenotes include footnote-style numberings, but they don't have to. <span class="marginnote">This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note.</span>These numberless sidenotes are called margin notes. They are currently identical to sidenotes but are kept semantically distinct because one might wish to style them separately.</p>

      <h2>Figures</h2>
      <p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.</p>
      <h3>Margin Figures</h3>
      <p><span class="marginnote"><img src="figure1.png"/>Figure 1: Sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species</span>Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte’s work. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <span class="code">p</span> tag.</p>
      <h3>Equations</h3>
      <p>For displaying mathematical symbols and equations I recommend <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Otherwise the topic is outside the scope of this document.</p>
      <h3>Full Width Figures</h3>
      <p>If you need a full-width image or figure, give it the <span class="code">fullwidth</span> class. Make sure that's inside an <span class="code">article</span>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. Don't wrap the figure in a paragraph tag. To give it a caption, add a sidenote placed in an otherwise empty paragraph tag after the image.</p>
      <p class="code">qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, colour = factor(cyl))</p>
      <img class="fullwidth" src="figure2.png"/>
      <p><span class="marginnote">Figure 2: Full width figure</span></p>
      <h3>Main Column Figures</h3>
      <p>Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column. You're going to have to police yourself with the size of these figures, since they're just images. Wrap the figure in a paragraph tag, into which also goes the caption, before the image.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="marginnote">Figure 3: A figure the width of the main column</span>
        <img src="figure3.png"/>
      </p>

      <h2>Tables</h2>
      <p>Tabular data are presented with right-aligned text and minimal grid lines. Table labels are margin notes placed inside a <span class="code">p</span> tag that wraps the <span class="code">table</span>.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="marginnote">Table 1: first row of metcars.</span>
        <table>
          <thead><th></th><th>mpg</th><th>cyl</th><th>disp</th><th>hp</th><th>drat</th><th>wt</th></thead>
          <tbody>

          </tbody>
        </table>

      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>Code samples are monospace using the <span class="code">code</span> class, as I've been using in this document to denote HTML tags like the word 'code' earlier in this sentence. Code blocks use that class in conjunction with the <span class="code">pre</span> tag, which gives us indentation too:</p>
      <pre class="code">
;; functional programming:
(map tufte-style all-the-things)

// imperative programming:
for (i = 0; i++; i <= num) {
   all_the_things[i].useTufteStyle();
} 
      </pre>
