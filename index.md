# Hacking Mandarin
Pinyin ftw. Reading characters is fine, and can be picked up during vocab learning.

## Pronouns. ("I, he, she you, you(pl), we they")

Pronouns are straightforward in Mandarin, due to not needing gender.
## Common salutations, ("boy, girl, woman, man young, old")

## learn "to be" words, (am, is, are) and possession words.

## Learn question words "who what when where why"

## learn verb vocab, also learn how to say like, don't like for every person.

## numbers, calendar, time, day, morning & night

## colours sizes

## Measure words

## directions by practicing asking questions and answering them.

### left, right up (on top) down (under) here (near) there (next to) over there (far)

### conversation words: greetings, good buy thanks excuse me, sorry, you're welcome

## famliy members, friends, coworkkers, neighbors, etc. also job titles
